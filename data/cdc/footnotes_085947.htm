													<li><p>Data are from the <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/brfss/" target="_blank">Behavior Risk Factor Surveillance Survey (BRFSS)</a>, a state-based, random-digit-dial telephone survey of the non-institutionalized, civilian U.S. population 18 years of age and older.</p></li>
													<li><p>BRFSS data are self-reported. The case definition includes respondents who reported their cigarette smoking status; respondent's recall of their smoking status might be inaccurate. </p></li>
													<li><p>In 2011, new weighting methodology was used to calculate the final weights for the BRFSS data, which prevents the comparison of pre-2011 survey results with results from surveys in 2011 and forward. For data years before 2011, visit the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/brfss/brfssprevalence/index.html">BRFSS prevalence and trends data</a>.</p></li>
													<li><p>Number and percentages are weighted to population characteristics. In 2011, the weighting methodology for the BRFSS was changed significantly because cellphone samples were added to the traditional landline phone samples. </p></li>
													<li><p>Prevalence of current smoking is calculated using the BRFSS variable, “Current Smoking Calculated Variable
” (_RFSMOK3=2, or _SMOKER3 = 1 or 2), which corresponds to adults answering that they are current smokers.</p></li>
													<li><p>Current cigarette smokers are those who have smoked at least 100 cigarettes in a lifetime and currently smoke every day or some days. Former smokers are those who reported smoking at least 100 cigarettes during their lifetime but currently did not smoke. Never smokers are defined as those who reported not having smoked &gt;100 cigarettes during their lifetime. </p></li>

				<h3>Blanks or Missing Data</h3>
				<p>Blanks or missing data within the maps, tables, and charts may be due to one of the following reasons: (1) data were not collected, (2) data were collected but were not provided to CDC, or (3) data were incomplete or did not meet data quality standards.</p>

				<h3>Data Differences</h3>
				<p>Data presented on CDC's Tracking Network may differ from data that are presented on state or city tracking networks, state or city health department websites, and other source websites for the same measures. The differences may occur for many reasons, such as use of different population estimates, differences in processes and timing for updating data, or differences in how a measure is defined for environmental public health tracking purposes. Consult the indicators and measures descriptions and metadata that are provided on this site for more information.</p>

				<p><b>Purpose</b></p>
				<p><p>
This measure will 1) estimate the prevalence of smoking among the adult population, 2) show correlation of these data with Tracking Network hazard and health outcome data, and 3) allow users to easily access and interact with BRFSS data through a user-friendly interface. Additionally, these measures can guide the following public health surveillance tasks: 
    <ul>
        <li>Describing the distribution of smoking in the general population by state of residence</li>
        <li>Linking smoking data with health outcome measures, such as prevalence of high blood pressure and prevalence of high cholesterol, to determine if the linked measures identify environmental relationships that warrant further investigation or environmental public health action</li>
        <li>Planning and evaluating efforts to reduce the health burden from smoking </li>
    </ul>

				<p><b>Derivation of measure</b></p>
				<p><p>These measures were developed in collaboration with CDC&rsquo;s Division for Heart Disease and Stroke Prevention (DHDSP). DHDSP works with partners across government, public health, health care, and private sectors to improve prevention, detection, and control of heart disease and stroke risk factors, with a focus on high blood pressure and high cholesterol. DHDSP also works to improve recognition of the signs and symptoms of a heart attack or stroke and the quality of care before and after these events.<sup>1</sup></p>
<p>These measures are derived from Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) data,<sup>2</sup> which is a state-based, random-digit-dial telephone survey of the non-institutionalized, civilian U.S. population aged &ge;18 years. The survey collects information about modifiable risk factors for chronic diseases and other leading causes of death and is administered in English and Spanish.</p>
<p><b>Prevalence of current smoking is calculated using the BRFSS variable, &ldquo;Current Smoking Calculated Variable&rdquo;, which corresponds to adults answering that they are current smokers</b>. Sample weights were assigned based on BRFSS methodology (<a href="http://www.cdc.gov/brfss/data_documentation/index.htm">http://www.cdc.gov/brfss/data_documentation/index.htm</a>).</p>
<p>Note that the weighting methodology for BRFSS has been updated from post-stratification to raking since 2011. Given the changes in methodology of the national BRFSS in 2011, it is not recommended to compare prevalence estimates from before 2011 to those from 2011 and after.<sup>2</sup></p></p>

		<div id="collapseLimitations" class="panel-collapse collapse" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="headingLimitations">
			<div class="panel-body">
				<p><b></b></p>
				<p><p>BRFSS data have several limitations. First, BRFSS is a household survey that does not collect information from persons in institutions such as nursing homes, long-term care facilities, military installations, and correctional institutions. Therefore, the results cannot be generalized to these populations. Second, telephone surveys might have higher levels of noncoverage because some U.S. households cannot be reached by telephone. Although the estimates of characteristics for the total population are unlikely to be substantially affected by the omission of the households without telephones, some of the subpopulation estimates could be biased. Third, surveys based on self-reported information might be less accurate than those based on physical measurements and subject to information bias. Fourth, although the overall number of respondents in the BRFSS is more than sufficiently large for statistical inference purposes, subgroup analyses with a small sample can lead to estimates that are unreliable. Users need to pay particular attention to the subgroup sample size when analyzing subgroup data, especially within a single data year or geographic area.</p></p>

		<div id="collapseConstraints" class="panel-collapse collapse" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="headingConstraints">
			<div class="panel-body">
				<p><b>Use Constraints</b></p>
				<p><p>BRFSS does not measure smoking prevalence among institutionalized adults, the military, persons aged &lt;18 years, and residents without telephones. Smoking prevalence in households without telephones might be different than in those with telephones. The measure will provide estimates of smoking prevalence based on self-report using data from a population-based cross-sectional survey.</p>
<p>
Given the changes in methodology of the national BRFSS in 2011, comparing prevalence estimates from before 2011 to those from 2011- present is strongly discouraged.
