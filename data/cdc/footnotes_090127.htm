				<h3>Blanks or Missing Data</h3>
				<p>Blanks or missing data within the maps, tables, and charts may be due to one of the following reasons: (1) data were not collected, (2) data were collected but were not provided to CDC, or (3) data were incomplete or did not meet data quality standards.</p>

				<h3>Data Differences</h3>
				<p>Data presented on CDC's Tracking Network may differ from data that are presented on state or city tracking networks, state or city health department websites, and other source websites for the same measures. The differences may occur for many reasons, such as use of different population estimates, differences in processes and timing for updating data, or differences in how a measure is defined for environmental public health tracking purposes. Consult the indicators and measures descriptions and metadata that are provided on this site for more information.</p>

				<p><b></b></p>
				<p><p>Exposures to pesticides are self-reported unless very serious and exposure requires hospitalization or results in a major health outcome treated by a physician or emergency department.  Pesticide poisonings are likely underreported because of difficulty with diagnosis, incomplete reporting to surveillance systems, (Calvert, et al, 2004) symptoms not being recognized as a poisoning (Texas Department of State Health Services, 2010).  Chronic illnesses from long-term low-dose exposures, which may be more typical of pesticides exposures, are not included in poison control center data.  State-specific data has various fine distinctions from state to state. Utilization of PCs per unit population varies widely across the U.S., so it is very hard to compare between states. For example, just because CA sees more pesticide exposure calls compared to GA does not necessarily mean CA has more pesticide exposures; it could be due to the fact that PCs are called more in CA. Another limitation is that poison center practices vary by poison center, so their coding of reported exposures may be different; this will be noted in the footnotes section on the national portal noted as 'About These Data'.  Differences can often be seen in the coding of the data field 'Exposure Reason'.</p></p>

				<p>These are self-reported exposures to pesticides and as such are subject to significant underreporting. In addition, because these exposures are self-reported the type of pesticide may be mis-classified since the designation by the poison control center is based on the information provided by the caller.</p>
