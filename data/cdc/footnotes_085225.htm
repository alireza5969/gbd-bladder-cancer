													<li><p>Data provided by state and local Environmental Health Tracking Programs. Data are derived from state databases associated with Safe Drinking Water Act. States without data shown here may have data available through their state databases for drinking water.</p></li>
													<li><p>Disinfection byproducts (DBP) refer to a family of chemicals that form when disinfectants, such as chlorine, used in water treatment react with bromide and/or naturally occurring organic matter in the water, for example, decomposing plant material.</p></li>
													<li><p>Drinking water DBP concentrations are based on samples taken from public community water systems (CWS). Data from seasonal and emergency sources were not included.</p></li>
													<li><p>The DBP covered by these data include Haloacetic acids (HAA). The regulated Haloacetic acids, known as HAA5, are: Monochloroacetic acid, Dichloroacetic acid, Trichloroacetic acid, Monobromoacetic acid, and Dibromoacetic acid.      </p></li>
													<li><p>The Maximum Contaminant Level (MCL) for HAA5 is 60 micrograms per liter (or parts per billion).</p></li>
													<li><p>A water sample is designated as "non-detect" when the laboratory analysis cannot detect the analyte being measured.  A measure is designated as "non-detect" when samples from the same community water system (CWS) were non-detect for an entire year or quarter.</p></li>

				<h3>Blanks or Missing Data</h3>
				<p>Blanks or missing data within the maps, tables, and charts may be due to one of the following reasons: (1) data were not collected, (2) data were collected but were not provided to CDC, or (3) data were incomplete or did not meet data quality standards.</p>

				<h3>Data Differences</h3>
				<p>Data presented on CDC's Tracking Network may differ from data that are presented on state or city tracking networks, state or city health department websites, and other source websites for the same measures. The differences may occur for many reasons, such as use of different population estimates, differences in processes and timing for updating data, or differences in how a measure is defined for environmental public health tracking purposes. Consult the indicators and measures descriptions and metadata that are provided on this site for more information.</p>

				<p><b>Derivation of measure</b></p>
				<p>Disinfection byproducts measures will be developed from water system attribute and water quality data stored in state Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) databases such as the Safe Drinking Water Information System (SDWIS/State). Trihalomethanes comprise chloroform, bromodichloromethane, dibromochloromethane, bromoform and their sum, denoted total trihalomethanes (TTHM). Haloacetic acids comprise trichloroacetic acid, dichloroacetic acid, monochloroacetic acid, dibromoacetic acid, monobromoacetic acid, and their sum, denoted HAA5. Data will be cleaned and transformed to a standard format. Analytical results of drinking water samples (usually taken at entry points to the distribution system or representative sampling points after treatment) will be used in conjunction with information about each CWS (such as service population and latitude and longitude of representative location of the CWS service area) to generate the measures.</p>

				<p><p>Safe Drinking Water Act compliance data include only a handful of the hundreds of known DBPs (Weinberg et al. 2002), most of which occur in chemical classes other than THMs and HAAs. While compliance sampling for THMs and HAAs is directed at the DBPs thought to be most commonly produced by chlorination, non-regulated DBPs exist even among the THMs and HAAs.
Concern has also been expressed about iodinated THMs and HAAs which, while present in lower concentrations than the brominated and chlorinated THMs, are thought to be toxic at lower doses (e.g. Plewa et al. 2004).
THMs and HAAs may not be the most satisfactory indicators of DBP levels in waters subject to alternative disinfection methods that produce different DBPs in different proportions than chlorination (Richardson 2002, Weinberg et al. 2002) and may result in high levels of unregulated DBPs. Little is known about the quantitative occurrence of these DBPs in the distribution system (Richardson et al. 2002, Krasner et al. 2006). While the health effects of different DBPs may vary, with some suspected to be hazardous, few have been characterized for their effects on human health (Woo et al. 2002). 

Correlations among different DBPs can be relatively low (King et al. 2004, Rodriguez et al. 2004a) so that the measured concentrations of THMs and HAAs may not be good predictors of exposure to other DBPs or overall DBP exposure. THM4 or HAA5, which are the only available data in some state databases, may therefore tell little about the relative concentrations of the THMs or HAAs.

DBP levels vary seasonally (Singer et al. 1981, Whitaker et al. 2003, Rodriguez et al. 2004b). Quarterly samples may not capture maximum levels and may not even adequately reflect short term levels. They may therefore be inadequate for estimating exposure during critical periods of a pregnancy, which may be as short as tow to three weeks, especially if peak exposure matters more than average exposure. Furthermore, these fluctuations make it difficult to characterize levels with a single number such as an annual average and thus pose challenges to the development of meaningful synopses of patterns and trends.

DBP levels are spatially and temporally labile within a distribution system (Rodriguez et al. 2004b). THM levels increase with time after disinfection and therefore with distance from the treatment plant (Chen and Weisel 1998, Rodriguez and Sérodes 2001). HAA levels may increase or decrease (Chen and Weisel 1998, Rodriguez et al. 2004b), depending upon distribution system conditions. Rechlorination further increases DBP levels. For all but small distribution systems it is therefore impossible to adequately characterize DBP levels with a single value. DBP sampling locations may change over time, making it more difficult to compare measurements from year to year. Better estimation of DBP levels will require spatial and hydraulic modeling of distribution systems.
Water supply systems sample for DBPs on different schedules that range from quarterly to triennially. Different sampling frequencies complicate comparisons among different water supply systems. Long intervals between samples, although allowed only where THM and HAA levels have been found to be well under the MCL, create greater uncertainty about levels between sampling dates and require stronger assumptions when estimating exposure during short term events such as pregnancies. When allowed, annual or triennial monitoring takes place during the month of warmest weather and may therefore overestimate average DBP levels.
Water supply systems that have disinfection waivers generally have no DBP sample results. While the default assumption that these water supply systems have DBP concentrations of zero is generally reasonable, low levels of DBPs can be found in raw ground water, e.g., from surface contamination or from movement of chlorinated water from onsite wastewater treatment systems into ground water.
Human behavior greatly influences exposure, complicating efforts to estimate exposure from tap water measurements (Nieuwenhuijen et al. 2000, Kaur et al. 2004, Nuckols et al. 2005). Among the influences on exposure are showering and bathing time, consumption of tap water, use of bottled water, and exposure to water at workplaces or other locations outside the home. Moreover, ascertaining DBP levels in drinking water does not address other routes of exposure such as swimming (Villanueva et al. 2007, Zwiener et al. 2007). This consideration is not strictly a limitation of the measure but pertains to using the measure as an indicator of exposure.
Some state SDWA databases may contain only totals for THMs and HAAs and may not record sample results for individual DBPs. Measures involving individual THMs and HAAs cannot be calculated for these states.</p></p>
