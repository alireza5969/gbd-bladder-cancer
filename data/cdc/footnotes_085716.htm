				<h3>Blanks or Missing Data</h3>
				<p>Blanks or missing data within the maps, tables, and charts may be due to one of the following reasons: (1) data were not collected, (2) data were collected but were not provided to CDC, or (3) data were incomplete or did not meet data quality standards.</p>

				<h3>Data Differences</h3>
				<p>Data presented on CDC's Tracking Network may differ from data that are presented on state or city tracking networks, state or city health department websites, and other source websites for the same measures. The differences may occur for many reasons, such as use of different population estimates, differences in processes and timing for updating data, or differences in how a measure is defined for environmental public health tracking purposes. Consult the indicators and measures descriptions and metadata that are provided on this site for more information.</p>

				<p><b>Derivation of measure</b></p>
				<p><p>The PLACES Project is an expansion of the original 500 Cities Project. PLACES data are small area estimations using multi-level statistical modeling framework. The primary data sources are the CDC Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS), the Census 2010 population, and the American Community Survey estimates. Refer to the PLACES site for more information about the method used (<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/places/methodology/index.html">https://www.cdc.gov/places/methodology/index.html</a>) and find more details about each specific measure (<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/places/measure-definitions/index.html">https://www.cdc.gov/places/measure-definitions/index.html</a>).&nbsp;</p><p>Measure Definitions:</p><p>Lack of Health Insurance: Respondents aged 18-64 years who report having no current health insurance coverage.&nbsp;</p><p>Doctor Visits for Routine Checkup: Respondents aged &ge;18 years who report having been to a doctor for a routine checkup (e.g., a general physical exam, not an exam for a specific injury, illness, condition) in the previous year.&nbsp;</p><p>Visits to Dentist or Dental Clinic: Respondents aged &ge;18 years who report having been to the dentist or dental clinic in the previous year.&nbsp;</p><p>Mammography Use: Female respondents aged 50-74 years who report having had a mammogram within the previous 2 years.&nbsp;</p><p>Cervical Cancer Screening: Female respondents aged 21-65 years who do not report having had a hysterectomy and who report having had a recommended cervical cancer screening test. For female respondents aged 21-29 years, the recommended screening test is Pap test alone. For female respondents aged 30-65 years, there are three recommended screening tests with varying frequencies: (1) Pap test alone, (2) human papillomavirus (HPV) test alone, or (3) Pap test in combination with HPV test (otherwise known as co-test)&nbsp;</p><p>Colorectal Cancer Screening: Respondents aged 50-75 years who report having had 1) a fecal occult blood test (FOBT) within the past year, 2) a sigmoidoscopy within the past 5 years and a FOBT within the past 3 years, or 3) a colonoscopy within the past 10 years (2018) or Respondents aged 50&ndash;75 years who report having had a fecal occult blood test (FOBT/FIT) within the previous year; a FIT-DNA test within the previous 3 years; a sigmoidoscopy within the previous 5 years; a sigmoidoscopy within the previous 10 years with a FOBT in the previous year; a colonoscopy within the previous 10 years; or a CT colonography (virtual colonoscopy) within the previous 5 years (2020 to present).&nbsp;</p><p>Up-to-date on Core Clinical Preventive Services:</p><p>Women: Number of women &ge;65 years reporting having received all of the following:</p><ul><li>an influenza vaccination in the past year;</li><li>a pneumococcal vaccination (PPV) ever</li><li>either a fecal occult blood test (FOBT) within the past year, a sigmoidoscopy within the past 5 years and a FOBT within the past 3 years, or a colonoscopy within the previous 10 years</li><li>and a mammogram in the past 2 years.</li></ul><p>Men: Number of men aged &ge;65 years reporting having received all of the following:</p><ul><li>an influenza vaccination in the past year</li><li>a pneumococcal vaccination (PPV) ever</li><li>either a fecal occult blood test (FOBT) within the past year, a sigmoidoscopy within the past 5 years and a FOBT within the past 3 years, or a colonoscopy within the past 10 years.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>High Blood Pressure Medication: Respondents aged &ge;18 years who report taking medicine for high blood pressure.&nbsp;</p><p>Cholesterol Screening: Respondents aged &ge;18 years who report having their cholesterol checked within the previous 5 years.&nbsp;</p><p>Data on the number and percent of uninsured is derived from the U.S. Census Bureau&rsquo;s Small Area Health Insurance Estimates (SAHIE) program. SAHIE produces timely estimates for all counties and states by detailed demographic and income groups. The SAHIE program produces single-year estimates of health insurance coverage for every county in the United States. The estimates are model-based and consistent with the American Community Survey (ACS). The estimates are also based on an &ldquo;area-level&rdquo; model that uses survey estimates for domains of interest, rather than individual responses. The estimates are &ldquo;enhanced&rdquo; with administrative data, within Hierarchical Bayesian framework.</p><p>SAHIE Measure Definition of Insured: Is this person currently covered by any of the following types of health insurance or health coverage plan?</p><ul><li>Insurance through a current or former employer or union (of this person or another family member)</li><li>Insurance purchased directly from an insurance company (by this person or another family member)</li><li>Medicare, Medical Assistance, or any kind of government-assistance plan for those with low incomes or disability</li><li>TRICARE or other military health care</li><li>Indian Health Services*</li><li>VA (including those who have ever used or enrolled for VA health care)</li><li>Any other type of health insurance or health coverage plan (user specified)</li></ul><p>*People whose only health coverage is Indian Health Service are uninsured as IHS is not considered comprehensive coverage.</p></p>

				<p><p>BRFSS: As with all self-reported sample surveys, BRFSS data might be subject to systematic error resulting noncoverage, nonresponse, or measurement bias. To address noncoverage issues related to phone use, BRFSS, began including cell phone interviews in the 2011 data collection. Due to changes in sampling and weighting methodology, 2011 is a new baseline for BRFSS, and comparisons with prior year data are inappropriate.</p><p>SAHIE continually evaluates its methods and investigates other potential data sources for each release. For these reasons, they revise and improve their methodology with each successive release, as time and resources allow. The Tracking Program displays SAHIE data for 2014 onward, but previous years are available at <a href="https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/sahie/data/datasets.html">https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/sahie/data/datasets.html</a>.
