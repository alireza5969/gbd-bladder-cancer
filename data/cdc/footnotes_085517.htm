													<li><p>Data provided by state and local Environmental Health Tracking Programs. Data are derived from state databases associated with Safe Drinking Water Act. States without data shown here may have data available through their state databases for drinking water.</p></li>
													<li><p>Drinking water concentrations of TCE are based on samples taken from public community water systems. Data from seasonal and emergency sources were not included.</p></li>
													<li><p>The Maximum Contaminant Level (MCL) for TCE is 5 micrograms per liter (or parts per billion).</p></li>
													<li><p>A water sample is designated as "non-detect" when the laboratory analysis cannot detect the analyte being measured.  A measure is designated as "non-detect" when samples from the same community water system (CWS) were non-detect for an entire year or quarter.</p></li>
											</ol>
				</p>

				<h3>Blanks or Missing Data</h3>
				<p>Blanks or missing data within the maps, tables, and charts may be due to one of the following reasons: (1) data were not collected, (2) data were collected but were not provided to CDC, or (3) data were incomplete or did not meet data quality standards.</p>

				<h3>Data Differences</h3>
				<p>Data presented on CDC's Tracking Network may differ from data that are presented on state or city tracking networks, state or city health department websites, and other source websites for the same measures. The differences may occur for many reasons, such as use of different population estimates, differences in processes and timing for updating data, or differences in how a measure is defined for environmental public health tracking purposes. Consult the indicators and measures descriptions and metadata that are provided on this site for more information.</p>

				<p><b>Purpose</b></p>
				<p><p>These measures can assist by addressing the following surveillance functions:</p><ul>  <li>Distribution measures provide information on the number of CWS and the number of people potentially exposed to TCE at different concentrations. </li>  <li>Maximum concentrations provide information on the peak potential exposure to TCE at the state level.</li>  <li>Mean concentrations at the CWS level provide information on potential exposure at a smaller geographic scale. </li></ul></p>

			<div class="panel-body">
				<p><b>Derivation of measure</b></p>
				<p>TCE measures will be developed from water system attribute and water quality data stored in state Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) databases such as the Safe Drinking Water Information System (SDWIS/State). Data will be cleaned and transformed to a standard format. Analytical results of drinking water samples (usually taken at entry points to the distribution system or representative sampling points after treatment) will be used in conjunction with information about each CWS (such as service population and latitude and longitude of representative location of the CWS service area) to generate the measures.</p>

				<p><b></b></p>
				<p>Ground water systems may have multiple wells with different TCE concentrations that serve different parts of the population. Compliance samples are taken at each entry point to the distribution system.  In systems with separate wells serving some branches or sections of the distribution system, the system mean would tend to underestimate the TCE concentration of people served by wells with higher TCE concentrations.  Exposure may be higher or lower than estimated if data from multiple entry points for water with different TCE levels are averaged to estimate levels for the PWS.</p>

			<div class="panel-body">
				<p><b>Use Constraints</b></p>
				<p>The current measures are derived for CWS only. Private wells may be another source of population exposure to TCE.  Transient non-community water systems, which are regulated by EPA, also may be an important source of TCE exposure.  Measures do not account for the variability in sampling, numbers of sampling repeats, and variability within systems.  Concentrations in drinking water cannot be directly converted to exposure because water consumption varies by climate, level of physical activity, and between people.  Due to errors in estimating populations, the measures may overestimate or underestimate the number of affected people.</p>
